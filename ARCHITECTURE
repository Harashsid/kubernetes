KUBERNETES ARCHITECTURE:
...................................

DEVLOPER WRITES THE APPLICATION AND PUSH INTO DOCKER REGGISTRY AFTER CREATING THE IMAGE.

WE WRITE DEPLOYMENT ONJECT AND APPLY USING KUBECTL.

CONTROLPLANE READS THE OBJECT AND DPLOY THE APPLICATION IN APPROPIATER NODE.

CONTROL PLANE AND WORKDER NODE ARE TWO MAIN COMPONENTS OF KUBERNETES.

WORKERNODE COMPONENTS: RUNS ON EVERY NODE.RUN TIME ENVIRNMENTS
A.KUBLET: 
        JOINS THE NODE TO CLUSTER PLANE.IT ESTABLISHES CONNECTION BETWEEN NODE AND CONTROLPNACE AND RUNS PODS N THAT NODE.KUBELET READ PODS SPECS FROM CONTROL PLANE AND RUNS THE CONTAINER ALONG HEALTHY.
        SEPCIFY THE LIVENSS/READNIESS IN PODS SPECS WHERE KUBLET SEES THE PODS IS HEALTHY OR NOT

B.KUBE PROXY: NETWORK PROXY THAT RUNES ON EVERY NODE,WE KNOW TO EXPOSE APPLICATION RUNNING INSIDE/OUTISDE THE CLUSTER TO INTERNT ,WE USINF SERVICES.
              KUBEPROXY MANAGES THE NETWORK COMMUNICATION 
C.RUN TIME: KUBELET DOES NOT RUN CONTAINERS DIRECTLY,WE USE DOCKER EARLIER TO RUN CONTAINERS.NOW WE USE CRI IS CONTAINERD WHICH MANAGES AND LIFE CYCLE OF CONTAINERS.


CONTRL PLANE:
    APISERVER: EXPOSES API OF CLUSTER,WE USE KUBECTL,SDKS ETC TO CONNECT TO THE CLUSTE.IT HELPS TO CONNECT THE CLUSTER IN MORE SECURE WAY, 443 AND TLS CERTIFICATE.  ONCE HTTP SESSION ESTABLISHED, IT SEE FOR AUTHENICATION AND SEE AUTHRIZATION WHAT CAN DO ON CLUSTER.
    VALIDATES THE CONFIURATIONS OF OBJECTS,IF ANY TYPO,IT REJECTS THE DEPLOYMENT.

    ETCD: KEY VALUE HIGHLY AVAIBLE DATA BASE WHICH STORES CLUSTER STATE AND ITS COMPONENTS.

   SCHDULER: JUST WATCH THE NEWLY CREATED PODS IF IT IS NOT ASSIGNED TO NODE AND ASSINGS THE PODS BASED ON THE COMPUTE CONFIGURATIONS
             ONCE IT RECEIES THE POD SPECIFICATIONS,CHECKS WITH NODES FOR COMPUTE AND FILTER AND SCORE IT AND ASSINGS THE PODS TO NODE

   KUBE-CONTOLLER MANAGERS:

          REPLICATION CONTROOLER:RECONICALTION LOOP
          NODE CONTRLLER,
   CLOUD-CONTROLLER SCHDULER:
