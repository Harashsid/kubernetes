PROCESS STROIES DATA IN MERMORY/DESK OF A HOST
CONTAINER HAS INDIVIUDAL FILESYSTEM WHERE IT STORES DATA,ONCE CONTINER TERMINATED,FILES IN FILESYSTEM LOST

SO WE CREATE VOLUME AND ATTACH THE VOLUME TO COTNAINER FILE SYSETEM
STROAGE CLASE-->[HOST.EFS,AZURE FILE SYSTE,}PERSITENT VLUME(CLUSTER LEVEL-->HOW MUCH,ACCESS,MODE,STROAGECLASS}PVC-->NAEMSPACE LEVEL,HOW MUCH,WHAT ACCESS

DEPLOYMENTS-->WE USE VOLUME SECTIONS TO INJECT PVC WHICH IT REFERS PV WHICH IT REFERS STROAFE CLASS
